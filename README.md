# MAC-LEC: Large-Scale Brain Effective Connectivity Method based on Multi-Actor-Critic Network


## Dataset
In this paper, we test our model in mith simulated fMRI dataset,  ABIDE II and REST-meta-MDD. It is available [here](https://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/abide/abide_II.html)


 

## Quick Start
1, Download the datasets from the above link and put them under the data folder.
```bash
cd data
unzip histology.zip
unzip fluorescence.zip
```



2, Run `MAC-LEC.py` to the model



## Environment
The code is developed on one NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU with 24 GB memory and tested in Python 3.9.10 and PyTorch 1.13.1.
